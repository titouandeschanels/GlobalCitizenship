            <p>
                This is what we want to achieve with the Global Citizenship
                program (GC):

                    <TextBox>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                                Everyoneâ€™s perception of Global Citizenship
                                differs:
                                <br />
                            </span>
                            To develop a personal definition of what Global
                            Citizenship means to you in relation to others.
                        </p>
                    </TextBox>
                    <TextBox>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                                Personal transformation into active citizens:
                                <br />
                            </span>
                            To foster a deep sense of self-awareness by
                            providing you with tools and strategies along this
                            journey.
                        </p>
                    </TextBox>

                        <p>
                            <span>
                                Making abstract concepts more relatable to you:
                                <br />
                            </span>
                            By offering a Global Citizenship program centered on
                            your personal challenges.
                        </p>
                    </TextBox>
                    <TextBox>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                                This requires a new learning approach:
                                <br />
                            </span>
                            Combining the Being + Doing + Knowing and Challenge
                            Based Learning (CBL) frameworks.
                        </p>

            </ExplainBox>
